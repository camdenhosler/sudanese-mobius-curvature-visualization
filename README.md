# Sudanese Möbius Strip Visualization

## Overview

This project numerically constructs the Sudanese Möbius strip (a minimal surface in $S^3 \subset \mathbb{R}^4$), applies stereographic projection to $\mathbb{R}^3$, and visualizes the resulting distortion of metric and curvature related geometric quantities.


The code estimates local scale factors, the absolute mean curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the Gaussian curvature of the projected surface, and the difference in the intrinsic Gaussian curvature of the surface in $S^3$ and the projected surface.  An interactive visualization is included which allows for switching between the scalar fields.

## Key Features
* Parameterization of the Sudanese Möbius strip in $S^3$ (Lawson 1970)

* Stereographic projection of the Sudanese Möbius strip into $\mathbb{R}^3$

* Numerical Estimation of:
    *  Local scale factors in $\mathbb{R}^3$
    *  Absolute mean curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$
    *  Gaussian curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$
    *  Difference in Gaussian curvature between $S^3$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$

* Interactive visualization of scalar fields with radio buttons

## Quick Start

**Dependencies**

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy 1.26+
- Matplotlib 3.7+

**Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camdenhosler/sudanese-mobius-curvature-visualization.git
cd sudanese-mobius-curvature-visualization

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows: 
# venv\Scripts\activate

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

**Run**

```
python scripts/generate_figure.py
```

Interactive plotting works automatically if a GUI backend is active. If running in a Jupyter notebook or IPython a Qt backend could be used (e.g. ```%matplotlib qt5```) 

## Mathematical Context

Since the **Stereographic Projection** is conformal but not isometric (angles are preserved but distances are not) curvature will be distorted.  The purpose of this project is to visualize this distortion.  The **Sudanese Möbius strip** was chosen for this project since it is both **non-orientable** and is a **minimal surface** in $S^3$.  The surface being minimal implies its mean curvature in $S^3$ is zero everywhere.  Due to the extrinsic nature of mean curvature (dependent on the surface's orientation in $S^3$ before projection) this property allows for easier visualization of distortion brought about by the projection.  Due to the non-orientability of the surface the absolute value of the mean curvature was taken.

## Limitations

* Curvatures are computed numerically using finite differences on a uniform parameter grid

* Mean curvature values depend on the orientation in $S^3$ (since it's extrinsic)

* Although an orthogonal rotation matrix was used to rotate the surface off of the north pole singularity, some artifacts may still remain
